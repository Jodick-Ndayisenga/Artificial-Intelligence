# Week 5: Naive Bayes and Ensemble Methods in Agronomy

This week's lesson focuses on **Naive Bayes** and **Ensemble Methods** like **AdaBoost** and their applications in agronomy, specifically for tasks like predicting crop health, classifying soil types, and detecting pest invasions.

## **Lesson Outline**

### **1. Introduction**
In agronomy, machine learning models such as Naive Bayes and ensemble methods help make predictions. This week, we’ll learn:
- The basics of Naive Bayes and its reliance on probability.
- How boosting with methods like AdaBoost improves predictions by combining models.

### **2. Naive Bayes Classifier**

The **Naive Bayes** classifier is based on Bayes' Theorem, which we’ll explore with a real-world example: classifying crop health as "healthy" or "unhealthy" based on observed factors like leaf color, soil moisture, and pest presence.

#### **a. Conditional Probability**
**Conditional probability** is the probability of an event given that another event has already happened.

**Example**:
- If **Crop A** thrives in moist soil, **the probability of a crop being Crop A given that the soil is moist** is a conditional probability.

Formula:  
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
\]

#### **b. Bayes' Theorem**
Bayes’ Theorem calculates the probability of an event (like crop being unhealthy) based on evidence (like leaf color or soil moisture).

Formula:  
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

**Example**:
Determine if a crop is **unhealthy** based on whether the leaves are yellow:
- **A** = Crop is unhealthy.
- **B** = Leaves are yellow.

Bayes’ theorem helps find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that a crop is unhealthy given its leaves are yellow.

#### **c. Assumptions of Naive Bayes**
Naive Bayes assumes all features (like soil moisture, pest presence) are **independent**, given the class (e.g., healthy or unhealthy crop). Despite this unrealistic assumption, Naive Bayes often performs well and is computationally efficient.

### **3. Boosting and Ensemble Methods**

**Ensemble methods** improve predictions by **combining models**. **Boosting**, particularly **AdaBoost** (Adaptive Boosting), is one such method that creates a strong model from **weak learners**.

#### **a. Ensemble Methods**
By combining outputs of multiple models, ensemble methods reduce errors and increase accuracy.

#### **b. Boosting and AdaBoost**
**Boosting** focuses on correcting the mistakes of previous models. **AdaBoost** increases the weight of errors so that subsequent models pay more attention to them.

**How AdaBoost Works**:
1. The first model is trained with equal weights on data points.
2. After prediction, errors are identified, and the algorithm increases the weight of misclassified points.
3. The next model focuses more on errors from the previous model.
4. This repeats, combining all models for the final prediction.

**Example**:
Use AdaBoost to classify soil types as "fertile" or "infertile" based on factors like nitrogen content, pH, and organic matter.

### **4. Practical Activities**

#### **Activity 1: Implement a Naive Bayes Classifier for Text Classification**
Classify **pest descriptions** as "harmful" or "not harmful" to crops.

1. **Collect data**: Sample pest descriptions labeled as harmful or not.
2. **Preprocess text**: Convert text into features (e.g., presence of "damages leaves").
3. **Train the classifier**.
4. **Test the classifier**.

#### **Activity 2: Use AdaBoost to Improve a Decision Tree**
Use AdaBoost to improve a decision tree for classifying crop types based on environmental factors.

1. **Set up data** with features like soil type, sunlight, and water needs.
2. **Train a basic decision tree** and observe its errors.
3. **Apply AdaBoost** to improve accuracy by focusing on misclassified examples.
4. **Evaluate** the improvement in accuracy.

### **5. Week Project: Build a Spam Classifier Using Naive Bayes**

Create a spam classifier for agronomy-related emails, like newsletters or disease alerts, to classify messages as **spam** or **not spam**.

**Steps**:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather agronomy-related emails labeled as spam or not spam.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenize emails, remove stop words, and convert text to lowercase.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Represent text with word frequencies.
4. **Training the Naive Bayes Classifier**.
5. **Testing and Evaluation**: Classify new emails as spam or not and evaluate with metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
