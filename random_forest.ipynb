    "# Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Random Forests is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and control overfitting. It is widely used for both classification and regression tasks due to its robustness and ability to handle large datasets with higher dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Ensemble Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:  \n",
    "Ensemble learning refers to techniques that create multiple models and combine them to produce improved results. The idea is that by aggregating predictions from several models, the overall performance will be better than any single model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance**:\n",
    "- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Ensemble methods help to reduce the variance of a model, making it more robust against overfitting.\n",
    "- **Diversity**: By training on different subsets of data and features, ensemble models capture a variety of patterns, leading to more accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. How Random Forest Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests work by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training time and outputting the mode of the classes (for classification) or mean prediction (for regression) of the individual trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "- **Bootstrap Sampling**: Random Forests use a technique called bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to create multiple subsets of the original dataset by randomly sampling with replacement. Each tree is trained on a different subset of the data.\n",
    "- **Feature Randomness**: In addition to using different data subsets, Random Forests also introduce randomness in feature selection. When splitting a node, a random subset of features is chosen, and the best feature among this subset is used to make the split.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "1. **Bootstrap Sampling**: If you have a dataset of 100 samples, you might create 10 different subsets of 100 samples each by sampling with replacement.\n",
    "2. **Feature Selection**: For each split in a decision tree, instead of considering all features, a random subset (e.g., 5 out of 10 features) is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Advantages of Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Accuracy**: By aggregating the predictions of multiple trees, Random Forests can achieve higher accuracy than individual decision trees.\n",
    "- **Robustness**: The model is less sensitive to noise and overfitting due to the averaging of predictions.\n",
    "- **Feature Importance**: Random Forests can provide insights into feature importance, indicating which features contribute most to the model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Disadvantages of Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complexity**: The model can be more complex and slower to train compared to a single decision tree.\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: While feature importance can be derived, the overall model can be harder to interpret than a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Tree Pruning in Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike standard decision trees, Random Forests do not require pruning because they inherently avoid overfitting by averaging the results of multiple trees. Each tree is allowed to grow fully without pruning, which contributes to the ensemble's robustness.\n"
