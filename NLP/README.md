### Basics of Text Data and Natural Language Processing (NLP)

**Text Data** is any data in written form (words, sentences, paragraphs). This type of data is unstructured, meaning it doesn’t follow a fixed format. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a field in AI that focuses on making computers understand and interpret human language.

**Examples of NLP Applications**
- Sentiment Analysis
- Spam Detection
- Text Classification

---

### Collecting and Understanding Text Data

**Data Sources** for text can include:
- Social Media (tweets, comments)
- Emails (for spam detection)
- Product Reviews
- News Articles
- Chat Logs

**Data Collection**: Collect a dataset, ideally with labels for supervised learning (e.g., positive/negative for sentiment analysis, spam/not spam).

### Preparing Text Data: Cleaning and Preprocessing

Preprocessing text makes it easier for machines to understand. Common steps include:
1. **Lowercasing**: Convert text to lowercase.
2. **Removing Punctuation**: Remove punctuation marks.
3. **Tokenization**: Split text into smaller parts (tokens).
4. **Removing Stop Words**: Remove common words that don’t add meaning (e.g., "the," "and").

### Text Representation: Converting Text to Numbers

Machines can’t understand text directly, so we convert text into numbers.

**Common Techniques**
1. **Bag-of-Words (BoW)**: Represents each word by its frequency in the document.
2. **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**: Combines word frequency with the rarity of the word across documents.
3. **Word Embeddings**: Represents words in a vector space where similar words have similar vectors (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).

### Choosing a Task and Model

**Common NLP Tasks**
- Sentiment Analysis
- Spam Detection
- Text Classification

**Simple Models**
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic model often used in spam detection and sentiment analysis.
- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical model used for classification tasks.

### Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets

To evaluate a model’s performance, we divide the dataset:
- **Training Set**: Used to train the model.
- **Testing Set**: Used to evaluate the model's performance.

A common split is 80% training and 20% testing.

---

### Training the Model

“Training” involves teaching the model the relationship between text and labels by fitting it to the training data. The model adjusts its parameters to learn patterns in the data.

---

### Evaluating Model Performance

**Performance Metrics**
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: How often the model's positive predictions are correct.
- **Recall**: How well the model identifies all actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall.

Testing the model on the test set allows us to calculate these metrics and evaluate its effectiveness.

### Mini-Project: Sentiment Analysis on Text Data

**Objective**: Predict whether a sentence or review is positive or negative.

**Steps**
1. **Data Collection**: Use a labeled dataset with positive and negative samples.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess the text.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Convert text to BoW or TF-IDF vectors.
4. **Model Training**: Train a Naive Bayes classifier.
5. **Evaluation**: Test the model and calculate accuracy, precision, and recall.
